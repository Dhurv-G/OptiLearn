# **OptiLearnâš¡ - Interactive Learning Assistant**

OptiLearnâš¡ is an interactive AI-powered learning assistant designed to enhance the educational experience through conversational AI, real-time video interactions, voice input, and a drawable canvas for interactive learning. It leverages cutting-edge AI models for responsive chat, voice feedback, and image recognition.

> ðŸš§ **This project is currently under development.** Some features may change or be enhanced in future updates.

## **Features**

- **Conversational AI:** Communicate with an AI-powered tutor using text or voice.
- **Voice Feedback:** Get responses via voice using pyttsx3 and Google TTS.
- **Live Class Integration:** Join real-time live video classes via webcam using OpenCV.
- **Drawable Canvas:** Interactive drawing board where users can draw and submit images for AI interpretation.
- **AI Image Interpretation:** Integration with LLaVA model (via Ollama) to interpret user drawings in real-time.
- **Voice Input Support:** Speak your queries via microphone using Googleâ€™s speech recognition API.
